"process" is the program I use to automatically add includes and library code
to my C++ submissions before submitting.  You'll probably have to change a
few things before you can use it:
- Rename the .exes in the Makefile (if you're on Linux rather than Cygwin).
- Rename the directories in library.txt to your repository location.
- If you want to use it from gvim (say by pushing CTRL-P), add the following to
  your .gvimrc:
nmap <C-P> :%!{repository directory}/process.exe {repository directory}/includes.txt {repository directory}/library.txt<CR><CR>
